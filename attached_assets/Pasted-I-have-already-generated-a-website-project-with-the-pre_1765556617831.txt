I have already generated a website project with the previous prompt.  
Now I want you to MODIFY and UPGRADE the existing website with the following requirements:

======================
GALLERY PAGE → PORTFOLIO STYLE
======================
1. Convert the current Gallery page into a **Portfolio style page**, suitable for a distillery company where we upload:
   - CSR event images
   - Plantation visits
   - Distillery process photos
   - Bottle marketing shoots
2. Structure should support:
   - **Portfolio Categories** (CSR Events / Plantation / Distillery / Bottle Shots)
   - **Portfolio Items** (each CSR event = one item)

======================
CSR PORTFOLIO ITEM (IMPORTANT)
======================
For each CSR event page:
1. Ability to upload **multiple images** (5–20 per event)
2. These images should appear in:
   - **Lightbox gallery**
   - **Slider/Carousel view**
3. Navigation:
   - Back to Portfolio button
   - Next / Previous CSR event (optional)

======================
WORDPRESS-FRIENDLY STRUCTURE
======================
I want this project to mirror the structure of a future WordPress website.  
So please update the code according to:

1. Keep the folder structure clean (assets, pages, templates, json).
2. Write components in a way that can later be copied into Elementor (free version).
3. Use only features Elementor FREE supports (no pro widgets).
4. Avoid complex JS frameworks — keep it pure JS so it can embed into WordPress easily.
5. Re-organize gallery/portfolio code into small reusable templates.

======================
EMAIL SUBMISSION FORM (REQUIRED)
======================
Modify Contact Page:
- Include a working static email submission form using:
  - Formspree (recommended)
  - or Netlify Forms (commented instructions)
- Add:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Message
- Success + Error message UI

======================
FRONTEND IMPROVEMENTS
======================
1. Add Lazy-loading for all gallery/CSR images.
2. Make image grids responsive.
3. Add a simple JS-powered slider for CSR multi-image pages.
4. Add hover animations for portfolio thumbnails.
5. Improve visual style to match a “Premium arrack brand portfolio”.

======================
MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT
======================
Keep previous language system:
- English (default)
- Sinhala
- Tamil

Ensure new Portfolio + CSR pages also include translation placeholders in:
- en.json
- si.json
- ta.json

======================
DELIVERABLES
======================
1. Updated portfolio.html (previous gallery.html replaced)
2. New CSR event template page: portfolio/csr-event.html  
   (Use placeholders for 2 sample CSR events)
3. Slider/lightbox JS updates
4. Updated navigation to link Portfolio page
5. Updated JSON translation files
6. Updated Contact page with working email form
7. README updated with:
   - how to add new CSR events
   - how to add multiple images
   - how to upload to WordPress later
8. Keep everything deployable as a static site.

PLEASE MODIFY THE EXISTING PROJECT — DO NOT CREATE A NEW ONE.
